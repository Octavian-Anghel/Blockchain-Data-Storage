Assignment 5: Intro to DevOps CI/CD

This repository contains a simple set of sorting algorithms, and a suite of tests to ensure functionality of those algorithms. Our code is automatically put through several tests including linting, testing on Windows and Linux with Python 3.9 and 3.10, and packaging. This testing is implemented through GitHub Actions, and our code currently passes all 9 tests.
